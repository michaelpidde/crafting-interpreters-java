This is my implementation of the Java codebase from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. I have made slight modifications here and there based on my stylistic preferences and to assist in my own mental clarity of the subject matter. The vast majority of the work is not of my own creation aside from implementations of post-chapter exercises.
